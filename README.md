This is a machine learning model that predicts the soil moisture for given two datasets containing data about soil moisture, temperature and humidity.



This repository consists of a single .ipynb file and a the provided datasets in .csv format.



In order to get this project working we simply need to :



-- Run the Soil_Moisture_Predicting_System.ipynb file in the repository.

-- Make sure you run this file in either Google Colab (recmommended) or Jupyter notebook as it is a Jupyter source file.

-- In Google Colab make sure you have uploaded all the datasets provided in this repository and also you enter the correct path to the datasets.

-- In Jupyter Notebook make sure the path of all the respective datasets is entered correctly before running the program.



This repository consists of :

-- Soil_Moisture_Predicting_System.ipynb file which is the main file consisting of the machine learning model built.

-- user1_data.csv and user2_data.csv which are datasets that have been provided for training.

-- data1.csv and data2.csv which are datasets obtained from the above two datasets after performing certain data preprocessing steps on the given datasets.

-- data_comb.csv which is the final dataset obtained after merging data1.csv and data2.csv. This is the main dataset used for model training. 



The  Soil_Moisture_Predicting_System.ipynb file also consists of a results section at the end of the file where we have compared all accuracy scores and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of all the models that we have implemented 
This helps us choose the best model for the prediction process.
